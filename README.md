# Trixel
 A trixel is a 3 x 3 x 3 matrix. 
 A trixel has 3 columns, 3 rows, 3 layers, 27 elements. 
 A trixel can be used for a virtual 3D representation of the real world. 
 Ex: self-driving car, bio-chemical simulation, video-game, VR, high-performance /high-efficient computers.
 
 
 matrix (3,3,3)
Trixel for self-driving car:
 Layer 1

row1 is the SEC code // the time (sec, nano-sec)
row2 is the XYZ code // the distance (mm ,m)
 row3 is the RGB code // the colors   (rgb)
Layer2, Layer3 

 Trixel bio-chemical simulation
 Layer 1
row1 is the SEC code // the time
row2 is the XYZ code // the distance
row3 is the ANR code // the chemical composition (atomic number)
Layer2, Layer3
